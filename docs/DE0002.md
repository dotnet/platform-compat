# DE0002: Code Access Security (CAS) shouldn't be used

## Motivation

When .NET Framework was originally created, it tried to provide a managed sandbox that
allows restricting what parts of the process can do. Unfortunately, providing an
additional security boundary on top of the operating system has been proven to
be too difficult. As a result, there have been quite a few exploits that allows
code to escape the managed sandbox.

## Recommendation

We recommend not to use CAS for new code. For security purposes you should rely
on operating system provided security boundaries, for example on Windows you can
use Access Control Lists (ACLs).
