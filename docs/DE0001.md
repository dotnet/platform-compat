# DE0001: SecureString shouldn't be used

## Motivation

* The purpose of `SecureString` is to avoid having secrets stored in the process
  memory as plain text.
* However, even on Windows `SecureString` doesn't exist as an OS concept
    - It just makes the window getting the plain text shorter; it doesn't fully
      prevent it as .NET still has to convert the string to a plain text
      representation
    - The benefit is that the plain text representation doesn't hang around
      as an instance of `System.String` -- the lifetime of the native buffer is
      shorter.
* The contents of the array is unencrypted except on .NET Framework.
    - In .NET Framework, the contents of the internal char array is encrypted.
      We've trouble with supporting the encryption in all environments, either
      due to missing APIs or key management issues.

## Recommendation

Don't use `SecureString` for new code. When porting code to .NET Core, consider
that the contents of the array will not be encrypted in memory.

The general approach of dealing with credentials is to avoid them and instead
rely on other means to authenticate, such as certificates or Windows
authentication.
