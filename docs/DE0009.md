# DE0009: Environment.OSVersion shouldn't be used

## Motivation

This property doesn't not provide a consistent way to identify the exact OS and its version.

## Recommendation

Use the method `RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform` to identify the OS platform and avoid writing
code dependent on reported OS version, check for availability of needed features instead.
