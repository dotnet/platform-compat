# PC002: API not available in .NET Framework 4.6.1

## Cause

You're calling an API in .NET Standard that isn't available in the .NET Framework
4.6.1.

## Rule description

While the .NET Framework 4.6.1 is treated by NuGet as implementing .NET Standard
2.0, it doesn't fully implement it. This trade-off is explained in the
[.NET Standard][netfx-netstandard] specification.

## How to fix violations

You cannot reasonably guard your code against missing APIs. You only have two
options:

1. Not call the affected API.
2. Not run your code on .NET Framework 4.6.1.

## When to suppress warnings

Unless you stop calling the API entirely, you have to suppress this warning as shown in the following example:

```C#
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

[assembly: SuppressMessage("Usage", "PC002:API not available in .NET Framework 4.6.1", Justification = "This library will not run on .NET Framework 4.6.1")]
```
