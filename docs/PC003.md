# PC003: Native API not available in UWP

## Cause

You're P/Invoking into a native API from a .NET Standard project or a UWP
project but that API isn't available in UWP.

## Rule description

Not all Win32 APIs are available in UWP. While calling the API might work when
debugging the app, the app store will reject any apps that contain P/Invoke
declarations with unsupported APIs.

## How to fix violations

Remove the P/Invoke declaration. When targeting .NET Standard, consider cross-
targeting for UWP.

## When to suppress warnings

The tool might not be able to detect usages of APIs that part of your
application. If it's a native module that you deploy with your app, you should
suppress the warning.

```C#
class NativeMethods
{
    #pragma warning disable PC003 // Native API not available in UWP
    [DllImport("mycode.dll")]
    static extern int MyMethod();
    #pragma warning restore PC003 // Native API not available in UWP
}
```
