# DE0008: Thread culture properties shouldn't be used

## Motivation

These properties don't work consistently across operating systems and runtimes when used against 
any thread other than the current thread.

* In .NET Core, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown if a thread tries
to read or write these properties on a different thread.
* In .NET Framework, setting these properties isn't reliable for a different thread. 

## Recommendation

Use `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture` and `CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture` instead.
