# DE0008: Thread culture properties shouldn't be used

## Motivation

Thread culture properties don't work consistently across operating systems and runtimes when used against
any thread other than the current thread.

* In .NET Core, if a thread tries to read or write these properties on a different thread, an [`InvalidOperationException`](InvalidOperationException) is thrown.

* In .NET Framework, setting these properties isn't reliable for a different thread.

## Recommendation

Use [`CultureInfo.CurrentCulture`](CurrentCulture) and [`CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture`](CurrentUICulture) instead.
