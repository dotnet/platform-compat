# DE0005: SmtpClient shouldn't be used

## Motivation

[`SmtpClient`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.smtpclient) does not support many modern protocols. It is compat-only. It's
great for one off emails from tools, but does not scale to modern requirements
of the protocol.

## Recommendation

Use `MailKit` or other libraries.
