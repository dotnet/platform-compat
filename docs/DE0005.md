# DE0005: SmtpClient shouldn't be used

## Motivation

[`SmtpClient`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.smtpclient) doesn't support many modern protocols. It is compat-only. It's
great for one off emails from tools, but doesn't scale to modern requirements of the protocol.

## Recommendation

Use [`MailKit`](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) or other libraries.
